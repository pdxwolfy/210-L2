hello
Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined

After hoisting, this program is equivalent to:

```javascript
function hello() {
  var a;

  a = 'hello';
  console.log(a);

  if (false) {
    a = 'hello again';
  }
}

hello();
console.log(a);
```

So, the call on line 5 logs `hello`. Since `a` is local to `hello()`, line 13 fails to find a variable named `a`, and raises an `ReferenceError`.
