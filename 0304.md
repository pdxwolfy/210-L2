```javascript
var a
a = 1;

function foo() {
  a = 2;
  function bar() {
    a = 3;
    return 4;
  }

  return bar();
}

console.log(foo());
console.log(a);
```

Since `a` is declared at the global level and not declared elsewhere, all references to `a` are to the global variable.

Line 14 invokes `foo()`, which sets `a` to `2`, but then calls `bar()` which sets it to `3`. `bar()` then returns `4` and `foo()` also returns `4`, so line 14 logs `4`. At this point, `a` is 3, so line 15 lines `3`.
